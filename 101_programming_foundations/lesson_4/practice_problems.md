1. I initially thought []. [1, 2, 3] is the correct answer.
2. Count counts the number of elements returning a true value. I found count in the ruby docs.
3. [], since nil is not false. [1, 2, 3], is the correct answer.
4. {'a' => 'ant', 'b' => 'bear', 'c' => 'cat'}.
5. It removes a key/value pair and returns it as an array.
6. Initially I thought it was 2, called on the array, but it is 11, called on caterpillar.
7. Block's return value: true
   Return value of any?: true
   Output: 1
8. array.take(2) returns a new array, it is not destructive, per the ruby-docs.
9. "bear".
10. [1, nil, nil]
